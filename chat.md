# Prompt

Considering the function $f(x) = \sin(x)$ at $u=\pi/4$ and defining $F_{k}(x)$ as the Taylor's polynomial of degree $k$ of $f(x)$ at $u$, let $r_k(x) = f(x) - F_k(x)$ be the remainder of the Taylor's polynomial of degree $k$ of $f(x)$ at $u$.

Now, create a graph to show that $r_k(x)$ is $O(x^{k+1})$ as $x \to u$.

In order to do that, you should create a graph with $x$ in the range $[-2\pi, 2\pi]$ and $k$ in the range $[0, 10]$. The graph should show the ratio $r_k(x)/x^{k+1}$ as a function of $x$ for each $k$.
